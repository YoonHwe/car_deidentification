 지능형 CCTV를 위한 딥러닝 기반 자동차 번호판 비식별화 연구

This paper identifies whether a vehicle exists by receiving image or photo data. Using deep learning techniques, it shows how likely a specific object is a vehicle and what type of vehicle it is. When the vehicle is recognized, the vehicle area is displayed by displaying a box on the corresponding data. Vehicle license plate de-identification is performed by blurring the lower part of the displayed area.
